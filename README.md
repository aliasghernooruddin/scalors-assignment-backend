# Backend Assignment: Simple Todos and Reminder API

The assignment involves the creation of a TODO and Reminder REST JSON API using Django. Please use the following libraries and versions:

* Python 2.7 (we are currently migrating to 3, but a lot of the code is still 2.7)
* Django 1.10+ 
* Django Rest Framework 3.5+
* Celery 4+

## Simple TODO API (1-3h)

Create a CRUD API for a simple TODO Management application. TODOs are organized in boards, on every board there can be multiple TODOs. A TODO contains a title (str), done (bool), a created (datetime) and updated (datetime) timestamp. A board has a name (str). 

Via a REST API it must be possible to:

*   List all boards
*   Add a new board
*   Change a board's title
*   Remove a board
*   List all TODOs on a board
*   List only uncompleted TODOs
*   Add TODOs to a board
*   Change a TODOs title or status
*   Delete a TODO

User Management and Authentication is not required.

### Constraints

*   When listing all boards the JSON should have a todo_count field, but not the list of all todos
*   In the board's detail view all todos should be serialized and the todo_count should not be visible

## Reminder API (1-2h)

Another endpoint should allow the user to set reminders. A reminder contains an email address, a reminder text and a delay in minutes when it will be triggered. 

Via the REST API it must be possible to:

*   List all reminders
*   Create a new reminder
*   Remove a reminder

After the user provided delay the user should receive an email. If you don't want to work with email it's ok to replace the email address with a callback URL and to POST the serialized reminder to this URL.

### Constraints

Please use celery to implement the delayed execution.
